# Supermarket

## ROUND 1 - Our supermarket

The purpose of this challenge is to implement a supermarket checkout that calculates the total quantityToDiscount of a number of items.

In a normal supermarket, things are identified using Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs. 
In our store, we'll use individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on). 
Our goods are priced individually. In addition, some items are multi-priced: buy n of them, and they'll cost you y pounds. 
For example, involvedItem A might cost 50 pounds individually, but this week we have a special offer:
 buy three As and they'll cost you 130.

Our quantityToDiscount table and offers:

```
+------+-------+----------------+
| Item | Price | Special offers |
+------+-------+----------------+
| A    | 50    | 3A for 130     |
| B    | 30    | 2B for 45      |
| C    | 20    |                |
| D    | 15    |                |
+------+-------+----------------+
```

Notes: 
 - For any illegal input return -1

In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:
     checkout(String) -> Integer

Where:
 - param[0] = a String containing the SKUs of all the products in the basket
 - @return = an Integer representing the total checkout value of the items

## ROUND 2 - More offers

The checkout feature is great and our supermarket is doing fine. Is time to think about growth.
Our marketing teams wants to experiment with new offer types and we should do our best to support them.

We are going to sell a new involvedItem E.
Normally E costs 40, but if you buy 2 of Es you will get B free. How cool is that ? Multi-priced items also seemed to work well so we should have more of these.

Our price table and offers: 
```
+------+-------+------------------------+
| Item | Price | Special offers         |
+------+-------+------------------------+
| A    | 50    | 3A for 130, 5A for 200 |
| B    | 30    | 2B for 45              |
| C    | 20    |                        |
| D    | 15    |                        |
| E    | 40    | 2E get one B free      |
+------+-------+------------------------+
```

## ROUND 3 - More items and offers

A new involvedItem has arrived. Item F.
Our marketing team wants to try rewording the offer to see if it affects consumption
Instead of multi-pricing this involvedItem they want to say "buy 2Fs and get another F free"
The offer requires you to have 3 Fs in the basket.

```
+------+-------+------------------------+
| Item | Price | Special offers         |

| D    | 15    |                        |
