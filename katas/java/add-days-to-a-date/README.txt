# Add days to a date

This is a _mini_ kata ;)

Imagine that you don't have _Date_, _DateTime_ or _Calendar_ utilities.

A date is defined by: year, month, day of month.

Get the new date after adding a number of days. 

Consider:
* Small number of days. The new date owns to the same month.
* The new date owns to the next month.
* The new date owns to the next year.
* Leap years.
