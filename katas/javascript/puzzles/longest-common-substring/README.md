# Longest common substring of two strings

Inspired by [Alfie](https://alfie.prodo.ai/challenge/1), a rapid prototyping tool that gives you live feedback on your code.

Write a function that finds the longest common substring of two strings.

Starting point:

```
function lcs(strings) {
  return "";
}

lcs(input.split("\n"));
```
