# Code Katas

Programming is a [**craft**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship) and as any craft it must be practiced.

The term of _Code Kata_ was introduced in the book [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer) and it's related with the Japanese word [Kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata):

> ... are detailed choreographed patterns of movements practised either alone or in pairs.

_Code Katas_ are usually practiced in _Coding Dojos_ (meetings of craftspeople) through [XP](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ExtremeProgramming.html) practices:
* [TDD](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html)
* [Pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)
