# Code Katas

Programming is a [**craft**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship) and as any craft it must be practiced.

The term of _Code Kata_ was introduced in the book [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer) and it's related with the Japanese word [Kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata):

_Code Katas_ are usually practiced in _Coding Dojos_ (meetings of craftsmen) through [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) (XP practice).
